  "readme": "# “Leadfoot drives browsers insanely fast”\n\nLeadfoot is a JavaScript client library that brings cross-platform consistency to the Selenium WebDriver API.\n\nUnlike existing WebDriver client libraries that assume the remote server will just do the Right Thing, Leadfoot detects\nand works around inconsistencies in WebDriver server implementations, so you can just worry about making your tests\nwork—not bugs in WebDriver servers.\n\nEnhanced capabilities are also exposed to end-users about which features and APIs a remote environment supports, so\nyou don’t have to browser sniff to decide whether (for example) you’re testing a touch-device or a mouse-device.\nOptional convenience methods are also available for use, and support for chai-as-promised is built in.\n\nLeadfoot is also the only WebDriver client library that includes an exhaustive unit test suite that verifies that\nresults are consistently returned from *all remote drivers*. Through this test suite we have discovered and reported\nover 15 defects to upstream WebDriver server implementers.\n\nLeadfoot currently detects and corrects known defects in the following remote drivers:\n\n* InternetExplorerDriver 2.41.0\n* FirefoxDriver 2.41.0\n* ChromeDriver 2.9\n* SafariDriver 2.41.0\n* Selendroid 0.9.0\n* ios-driver 0.6.6\n\nLeadfoot is tested against IE8+ and all other modern browsers.\n\n## Using Leadfoot\n\nLeadfoot can be installed and used as a stand-alone WebDriver library from npm by running `npm install leadfoot`.\nHowever, we recommend using Leadfoot through the [Intern testing framework](http://theintern.io), which provides you\nwith all of the tools you need to write robust unit and functional tests. Follow the instructions on\n[writing functional tests with Intern](https://github.com/theintern/intern/wiki/Writing-Tests-with-Intern#functional-testing)\nto learn how to use Leadfoot with Intern.\n\n## WD.js compatibility\n\nA compatibility layer is provided to expose APIs that are signature-compatible with the variant of WD.js 0.2.2 used by\nIntern 1. Use of these APIs will emit deprecation warnings. This compatibility layer will be removed in a future\nrelease.\n\n## License\n\nLeadfoot is available under the terms of the [New BSD License](LICENSE). All code is developed under the terms of the\n[Dojo Foundation CLA](http://dojofoundation.org/about/cla).\n\n© 2014 SitePen, Inc. http://sitepen.com\n",
